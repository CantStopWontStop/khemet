# Introduction to Functions in R

R provides a wide range of built-in functions that perform specific tasks and operations. These functions are designed to handle different types of data and perform various computations. Here are some commonly used categories of built-in functions in R:

1.  Mathematical Functions: These functions are used for performing mathematical operations on numeric data. They include functions such as **`sum`**, **`mean`**, **`max`**, **`min`**, **`sqrt`**, and **`round`**. For example:

```         
RCopy code
```

`# Compute the sum of a vector numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) result <- sum(numbers)  # Calculate the mean of a vector values <- c(10, 15, 20, 25) result <- mean(values)`

2.  Statistical Functions: These functions are used for statistical computations on data. They include functions such as **`sd`** (standard deviation), **`var`** (variance), **`median`**, and **`quantile`**. For example:

```         
RCopy code
```

`# Calculate the standard deviation of a vector data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25) result <- sd(data)  # Compute the median of a vector numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) result <- median(numbers)`

3.  Character Manipulation Functions: These functions are used for manipulating and processing character strings. They include functions such as **`paste`**, **`substr`**, and **`nchar`**. For example:

```         
RCopy code
```

`# Concatenate character strings first_name <- "John" last_name <- "Doe" full_name <- paste(first_name, last_name)  # Extract a substring text <- "Hello, world!" substring <- substr(text, start = 1, stop = 5)  # Compute the number of characters in a string message <- "Welcome to R!" length <- nchar(message)`

These are just a few examples of the many built-in functions available in R. As you progress in your data analysis and visualization journey, you will encounter and explore a wide range of functions that cater to specific needs and tasks.

To explore the available functions and learn more about their usage and parameters, you can refer to the official R documentation or search for specific function references and tutorials online. Additionally, the **`help()`** function and the **`?`** operator in R can provide information about specific functions directly within the R environment.
